# Classifier

This is a Rust implementation of a gradient boosting model, tailored to fit stock data and predict whether the next closing price will be above/below the next opening price. On S&P500 data from 2016, it has a ~0.61 accuracy rate, which means patterns were found and the model works 10% better than just guessing.
